# Roadmap

This document contains all information regarding future changes and known issues on Antonio Lucio.

## Planned Features

The following will be added to Antonio Lucio in the future, in no particular order:

- Command Chain Flags that control whether to show only the domain name in the address field
- Ongoing updates to maintain compatibility with the latest stable Version of Vivaldi Browser.

## Known Issues

- When "Tab Stacking" is set to "Accordion", the border of a tab stack will not correctly enclose all tabs of a stack when expanded.
- When "Menu Position" is set to "Horizontal", the horizontal menu will be covered by the address bar.
- When "Use Native Window" is enabled, the address bar will still leave a gap for nonexistent window buttons.
